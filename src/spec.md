## Summary
**Goal:** Replace the existing site logo and favicon with the new FLAME COMPLAINTS branding.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace the main logo at frontend/public/assets/generated/flame-issue-tracker-logo.dim_512x512.png with the new FLAME COMPLAINTS logo
- Update the favicon to match the new FLAME COMPLAINTS branding

**User-visible outcome:** The site displays the new FLAME COMPLAINTS logo with blue and orange flame icon in the header across all pages, and the browser tab shows the updated favicon.
